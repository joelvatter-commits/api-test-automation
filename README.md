# API Test Automation Framework 🚀

## About the Project
This repository contains an automated testing framework built with **Python** and **Pytest**. It is designed to validate REST API endpoints by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Currently, the tests run against the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to simulate real-world usage without triggering bot protections.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
  * `requests` (HTTP calls)
  * `pytest` (Test execution & assertions)
* **Environment:** Virtual Environment (venv)
